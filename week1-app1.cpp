// Lecture contents will be available in the LMS
// code will be available in https://github.com/furkankirac/cs409-2020-21-spring

// History of C++
// Core language + Standard Library
// Standard Library: libstdc++, libc++
// CMake: is important, not very likable, but nothing better than it right now :(

// Consider CS321 as a weak prerequisite:
//  if you didn't get CS321, remember that you can always withdraw the course by the middle of the term

// Midterm Exam 1 (50%) End of April
// A difficult problem to be solved in xx-days time (open-book)
// Your unique solution is required

// Midterm Exam 2 (50%) Beginning of June
// A difficult problem to be solved in xx-days time (open-book)
// Your unique solution is required

// Will use:
//   Compiler: Clang 11.1+, GCC 10.2+ and C++20 standard.
//   You can use one of Clang, GCC, MSVC compilers, and any editor of your choice.
//   However, I would highly suggest you to use Qt Creator if not familiar with C++.
//   Editor: Qt Creator 4.14+. Why? Lightweight, very nicely supports CMake.

// COMPILER CONFORMANCE: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support

#include <iostream> // implemented for instance in libstdc++, or libc++, STL

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
